        <h3>Football</h3>
        <p>
          Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
          kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football
          normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the
          word is used. Sports commonly called football include association
          football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron
          football (specifically American football or Canadian football);
          Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic
          football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent
          common origins and are known as football codes.<br />
          <b>Ancient Greece and Rome</b><br />
          The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball
          games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game
          harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game
          known as "ἐπίσκυρος" (Episkyros)[17][18] or "φαινίνδα"
          (phaininda),[19] which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes
          (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement
          of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD). These games appear to have
          resembled rugby football.[20][21][22][23][24] The Roman politician
          Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst
          having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball
          games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis.[25][26] Episkyros
          is recognised as an early form of football by FIFA.[27]<br />
          <b>Native Americans</b><br />
          There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or
          prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different
          parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by
          an English explorer named John Davis, went ashore to play a form of
          football with Inuit people in Greenland.[28] There are later accounts
          of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with
          two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to
          kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In
          1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a
          game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman.[citation needed]
          Pasuckuakohowog, a game similar to modern-day association football
          played amongst Amerindians, was also reported as early as the 17th
          century.
