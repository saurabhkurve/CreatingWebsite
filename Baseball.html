        <h3>Baseball</h3>
        <p>
          Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams, of
          nine players each, that take turns batting and fielding. The game
          proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher,
          throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a
          bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the
          ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases,
          having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what
          are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team)
          is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners'
          advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored when a runner legally
          advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place
          where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most
          runs by the end of the game is the winner.The first objective of the
          batting team is to have a player reach first base safely. A player on
          the batting team who reaches first base without being called "out" can
          attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately
          or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent
          runs by getting batters or runners "out", which forces them out of the
          field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting
          the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and
          forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is
          over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for
          each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine
          innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of
          the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra
          innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most
          games end in the ninth inning. Baseball evolved from older
          bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th
          century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where
          the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was
          widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball
          is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America,
          the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and
          Taiwan. In the United States and Canada, professional Major League
          Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and
          American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and
          Central. The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in
          the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan
          between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West
          League and East League. The World Baseball Classic, organized by the
          World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international
          competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from
          around the world.
