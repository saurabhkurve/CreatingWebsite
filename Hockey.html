        <h3>Hockey</h3>
        <p>
          Hockey is a term used to denote various types of both summer and
          winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet
          of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. There are many types of
          hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed
          while others do not. In order to help make the distinction between
          these various games, the word "hockey" is often preceded by another
          word i.e. "field hockey", "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink
          hockey", or "floor hockey". In each of these sports, two teams play
          against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a
          type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal
          using a hockey stick. Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and
          an open disk (still referred to as a "puck") with a hole in the center
          instead. The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were
          codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks.
          The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly
          the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for
          inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. n
          more recent history, the word "hockey" is used in reference to either
          the summer sport of field hockey, which is a stick and ball game, and
          the winter ice team skating sports of bandy and ice hockey. This is
          due to the fact that field hockey and other stick and ball sports and
          their related variants preceded games which would eventually be played
          on ice with ice skates, namely bandy and ice hockey, as well as sports
          involving dry floors such as roller hockey and floor hockey. However,
          the "hockey" referred to in common parlance often depends on locale,
          geography, and the size and popularity of the sport involved. For
          example, in Europe, "hockey" more typically refers to field hockey,
          whereas in Canada, it typically refers to ice hockey.
          The first recorded use of the word hockey is in the 1773 book Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education by Richard Johnson (Pseud. Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled "New Improvements on the Game of Hockey".[2] The belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by King Edward III of England[3] is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games "Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam".[4][5] The English historian and biographer John Strype did not use the word "hockey" when he translated the proclamation in 1720, instead translating "Canibucam" as "Cambuck";[6] this may have referred to either an early form of hockey or a game more similar to golf or croquet.
